--- Installing the APK to /system/app

http://androidforums.com/droid-all-things-root/64603-installing-apk-in-system-app-directory.html

App - ROOT explorer: see the extras folder of the project.

To do this:

    In Root Explorer, copy the apk file you want to put in /system/app
    Navigate to the /system/app directory
    Tap the Mount R/W button on the top right
    Tap Paste
    Scroll down to the pasted apk, long press on it and select Permissions (you'll see 9 check boxes when you do this)
    Check the Read and Write buttons for User, and only the Read boxes next to Group and Others, then tap OK (once you're done, the read/write permissions under the app name should be the same as all the other apps listed (rw-r--r--))
    Reboot.
